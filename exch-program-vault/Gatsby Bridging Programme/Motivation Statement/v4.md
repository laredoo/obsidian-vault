### Briefing

Now, it's time to refine. I need to make somethings more subtil and also maybe change a bit. I don't need to get to deep into the Gatsby Unit's research maybe. Talk more concretely about the research is good.

Coming from Brazil, where research opportunities are limited, pursuing academia often means balancing work with studies, which is challenging. While working as a Python cloud software engineering intern to support myself through university, I secured an undergraduate research scholarship in Bioinformatics. This opportunity led me to collaborate with neuroscience laboratories during a data-driven project for the establishment of the Brazilian National Vaccination Center. Through implementing laboratory information management systems and data pipelines, I consolidated knowledge into neuroscience research workflows and methodologies.

My formal introduction to Machine Learning during coursework deepened my interest in the parallels between artificial and biological neural systems, leading to my thesis work proposal. The implementation of a computer vision-based cFOS analysis tool presents an opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the field. This initiative also represents an important step toward my long-term goal: joining the ERASMUS Joint Master's Degree in Brain and Data Science program.

However, while I can implement simple models using machine learning libraries, the Gatsby Bridging Programme offers fundamentals needed to move beyond merely using black-boxes to understanding their mathematical principles. I've realized that my computer science-based approach, while valuable, isn't sufficient for the deep understanding I seek. Concepts covered by this programme - from Dynamical Systems to Fourier Analysis - are crucial gaps in my knowledge that I need to fill, both for my current thesis and future research. The programme also represents more than just academic training; it offers me the rare opportunity to fully immerse myself in learning these fundamental concepts without the constant pressure of balancing work and studies. My journey demonstrates my determination to overcome challenging research circumstances while pursuing academic excellence in computational neuroscience aiming for meaningful impact.
