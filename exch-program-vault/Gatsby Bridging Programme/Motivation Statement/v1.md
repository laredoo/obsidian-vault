You should use the statement to demonstrate your interest in and potential for pursuing a scientific career in machine learning (ML) and/or theoretical neuroscience (TN) and explain why you want to participate in the programme. Think about why you are applying, how you will benefit from it and what you hope to gain.

Please note that the Gatsby Bridging Programme is not an ML/TN summer school. The goal of the programme is to provide participants with a solid mathematics foundation to be able to enter these fields. If you already have the necessary mathematics foundation, you may wish to look into other opportunities offered by the Gatsby Unit

**Old Introduction (94 words)**

*The field of Machine Learning demands more than proficiency in programming languages and pre-trained models. Achieving effective academic results in the field requires a solid foundation in mathematics and statistics. As a final year Information Systems student in Brazil and aspiring Theoretical Neuroscience Master's candidate, I recognize that my current mathematical knowledge does not reach the required level of excellence for this field. While my background in Computer Science is solid, it is not yet sufficient to meet these demands. The Gatsby Bridging Programme provides an opportunity to deepen my mathematical knowledge and consolidate remaining concepts.*

**Old first paragraph (94 words)**

The convergence of computational methods and neuroscience is fascinating. Collaborating as an undergraduate researcher on a Bioinformatics data analysis based project, focused on the optimization of Laboratory Information Management Systems, was my first exposure of how computer science can be combined with biological fields. As i progressed through my academic experience, the neurotechnology field has been introduced to me through a study that applied dynamic functional connectivity analysis to investigate effects of ketamine with the help of computational linear algebra concepts, such as Eigenvector Decomposition to calculate Dynamic Functional Connectivity matrices. 

## Statement

Implementing sofisticated models requires more than programming proficiency - effective academic results in the field requires a robust foundation in mathematics and statistics. As a final year Information Systems student in Brazil and aspiring Theoretical Neuroscience Master's candidate, I recognize that advancing in this field requires deeper mathematical expertise beyond my current computational background. The Gatsby Bridging Programme provides the exact opportunity to deepen fundamental mathematical knowledge and solidify the remaining concepts needed in this interdisciplinary journey.

The convergence of computational methods and neuroscience is fascinating. My journey began as an undergraduate researcher in Bioinformatics, where a data analysis based project aiming optimize Laboratory Information Management Systems showed me how computer science could transform biological research. This foundation led me to explore neurotechnology, where i encountered a study applying dynamic functional connectivity analysis to investigate ketamine's effects on mices. The thesis that worked with computational linear algebra concepts, such as Eigenvector Decomposition to calculate Dynamic Functional Connectivity matrices, introduced me  the insection of mathematics and neuroscience that i hope to pursue. 

A technology-based bachelor's background provided me an introduction to Machine Learning. Through coursework, new perspectives on neurotechnology's potential were introduced.  A key example was the introduction to neural networks, that instigated my curiosity about the parallels between artificial and biological neural systems. This intersection inspired me to explore the field further, ultimately leading me to an interestin the ERASMUS Joint Master's Degree in Brain and Data Science.

Despite being introduced to Machine Learning and foundational mathematical concepts, the computer science-based approach I have experienced is insufficient to fulfill the level of mathematical expertise required to excel in neuroscience and neurotechnology. Key concepts covered in in the Gatsby Bridging Programme, such as Dynamical Systems and Fourier Analysis, are well beyond my current knowledge. For these reasons, the program presents an exceptional opportunity to deepen my mathematical understanding and build the solid foundation necessary to tackle the complexities of brain data science and computational neuroscience.
