#gatsby-bridging-programme #uk #motivation-statement

## Description

You should use the statement to demonstrate your interest in and potential for pursuing a scientific career in machine learning (ML) and/or theoretical neuroscience (TN) and explain why you want to participate in the programme. Think about why you are applying, how you will benefit from it and what you hope to gain.

Please note that the Gatsby Bridging Programme is not an ML/TN summer school. The goal of the programme is to provide participants with a solid mathematics foundation to be able to enter these fields. If you already have the necessary mathematics foundation, you may wish to look into other opportunities offered by the Gatsby Unit
