### Briefing

The idea now is to create a story. I need a story telling, you know? Something that i can get their appeal. Also, it can be a nice idea to change my interest in Gatsby to anything more specific, maybe the Kernel research.

## Claude's Suggestion

As an aspiring Theoretical Neuroscience researcher and final year Information Systems student in Brazil, I've discovered that my computational background, while strong, leaves gaps in the mathematical foundations, crucial for understanding neural systems. While I can implement models using machine learning libraries, the Gatsby Bridging Programme offers fundamentals needed to move beyond merely using tools to understanding their mathematical principles.

Coming from Brazil, where research opportunities are limited and pursuing academia often means balancing work with studies is challenging. While working as an intern to support myself through university, I secured an undergraduate research scholarship in Bioinformatics. This opportunity led me to collaborate with neuroscience laboratories during a data-driven project for the establishment of the Brazilian National Vaccination Center. It was here that I first encountered neuroscience research, particularly through a paper on receptor inhibition and its effects on cocaine-induced behavioral changes.

My formal introduction to Machine Learning during coursework deepened my interest in the parallels between artificial and biological neural systems.  Particularly instigated by intelligent behaviour models. This exploration led me to discover Gatsby Unit's research. In special, Professor Arthur Gretton's research addressing AI system's capacity to generate faithful samples based on real-world objects, specially images, intersects with my undergraduate thesis project proposal: the implementation of a computer vision-based cFOS analysis tool, allowing me to finally contribute meaningfully to the field.

However, I've realized that my computer science-based approach, while valuable, isn't sufficient for the deep understanding I seek. The mathematical concepts covered by this programme - from Dynamical Systems to Fourier Analysis - are crucial gaps in my knowledge that I need to fill, both for my current thesis and future research. The Gatsby Bridging Programme represents more than just academic training; it offers me the rare opportunity to fully immerse myself in learning these fundamental concepts without the constant pressure of balancing work and studies. As I look toward my goal of joining the ERASMUS Joint Master's Degree in Brain and Data Science program, this foundation will be invaluable for my academic future.
