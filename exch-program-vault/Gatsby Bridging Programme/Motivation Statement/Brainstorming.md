### Why i am applying?

Here **i must** emphasize my interest in Neuroscience. This program is **focused** on the introduction of Mathematical concepts necessary to people that aim to join Neuroscience and ML. It's **explicit** on their website and it's the goal of the program.

So *why i am applying?* Because i want to improve my mathematical concepts and knowledge so i can join a Neuroscience program? Which one, the ERASMUS Mundus program. **That is the key to it**. 

Fine, but ain't my mathematical knowledge already enough? **It can't be**. The focus of the program is in students with background that **LACK** deep mathematical introduction. So i must frame it like that. It's important to *convince* that i also need to improve my knowledge.

In a **very** subtil way i could also introduce the idea that some international experience may be very accepted, and this program is an opportunity to aglutinate all these interests together.


1. **Interest in Neuroscience**
	1. Where does it come from? Bioinformatic background and Emilie (friend Msc Student)
2. **Need to improve mathematical knowledge**
	1.  It's simply not sufficient. Systems of Information does not provide enough mathematical background
	2. A lot of subjects focused on Administration and CS (obviously)
3. **Justify that my mathematical background is not enough**
	1. Even though i've had some introduction to mathematical concepts it's not enough. Okay, but why? Give insumes based on the program
	2. Lack of Calculus III, Differential Equations, Transforms and stuff
4. **Importance of international experience**
	1. My CV lacks an International Experience, this program is very useful to provide it and help with applications.

### Why do i want to be in Gatsby Bridging Program?

A lot of intersection with the previous criteria. The program means ***academic*** qualification. It's literally qualifying for academia. 

Perfect. This means i'm in because **I WANT TO LEARN MATH**. I need to be in here to fulfill gaps in my mathematical knowledge. Give literal examples, like the previously mentioned. 

It's important to make it real, sound like i really know what i want and why this is interesting to me.

SHOW THEM WHO I AM AND Y I WANT THIS **SO SO SO** BAD.

### How i am interested in ML/Neuro?

Here's the thing... How am i interested on it. 

About ML it's easy... I can give a SUPER SHORT background explanation. It must be quick and be used to justify something: I am interested on it, and i know prior mathematical knowledge is needed. **ML is more than just using Python libraries, how do them work? I also need to know...**

And Neuroscience? Show them the intersection of them two, and why it interests me. This here is a nice opportunity to introduce a objective interest. I want to be part of the ERASMUS program. So it gives them inputs for real goals and targets.

### What's My Potential?

Ugh... Though though one.

What is my potential? Honestly i don't know. I must use the right words... Not to show up a lot, i am not as good, but i want to show that **I HAVE THE AMBITION** to be good (humble).

So my potential is great (i can learn) but i also have a lot to learn. You see?

### How the Program Help?

Redundant. It helps by mentioning the previous topics, with math and international experience. 

Also, may be nice to say that i hope to me involved with people from the FIELD (ML and Neuroscience). 

Oh, something great might be mentioning their ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE. Super great results from previous ALUMNI (Google Deep Mind) and research experience. 

### What am i getting from it?

**Knowledge** **Knowledge** **Knowledge** **Knowledge** **Knowledge** 

That's it. I am getting a chance to learn. Okay, but practically? I am being introduced to new concepts that **help** with Neuroscience, modeling, going further than just using libraries, but understanding them.

Great. Let's write.
