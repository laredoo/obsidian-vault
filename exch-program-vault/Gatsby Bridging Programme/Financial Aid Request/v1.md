## Financial aid request 

As a Brazilian student balancing work and study to support myself through university, my current circumstances make attending the programme financially challenging without assistance. While living with my family in Brazil helps manage my living costs, they are not in a position to provide financial support for my studies in London. My monthly income of around BRL 1,650 (around GBP 223) covers my basic needs in Brazil, but this amount would be severely insufficient for London's living costs.

The financial challenges are significant: accommodation in London would exceed my entire monthly Brazilian salary, not accounting for essential expenses like food and transport. Additionally, the flight ticket (approximately Â£800) represents nearly four months of my current income. The substantial currency exchange rate difference between Brazilian Real and British Pound further compounds these difficulties.

Without financial assistance, I would be unable to leave my current job and attend the programme, despite my demonstrated commitment to academic excellence while working. The opportunity to fully focus on absorbing the programme's mathematical foundations would be transformative for my academic journey, but it remains out of reach without a bursary.
